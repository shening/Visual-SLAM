 * Map of the world, of points and keyframes.
 * The world map consists of a set of 3D points, 3D reference points, and keyframes that observe them.
 * ORB-SLAM uses a single map that is created in main.cc, it is passed to the constructors of the 3 threads (tracking, loopClosing, localMapping),
 * The MapPublisher constructor and framePublisher.
 * The map has a mbMapUpdates flag, protected, which indicates whether the map is updated or, on the contrary, there is some BA in process.
 * LocalMapping and loopClosing are the two threads that carry out BA, and when finished they correct the flag with SetFlagAfterBA ().
 * The flag may be false for very short periods in other updates, such as adding or deleting a point.
