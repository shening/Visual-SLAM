/* * Vocabulary that maps ORB descriptors with Bow.
 * OBRVocabulary is a template-based type that defines a type of descriptors and a class of DBOW2 functions to manipulate them.
 * OBRVocabulary uses Mat as descriptor (TDescriptor is Mat), and the FORB class as implementation specific for ORB
 * Of the general descriptor manipulation functions required by DBOW2.
 *
 * Main.cc creates the only instance of this object, loads its vocabulary from a file,
 * And then passes it as a reference to the main constructors, starting the cascade.
 * In the future, every object that needs a vocabulary receives it by reference when it is built.
 *
 * Frame, KeyFrame, LoopClosing and Tracking call it mpORBvocabulary.
 * KeyFrameDatabase calls it mpVoc.
 * Frame and KeyFrame use only their transform method, which obtains BoW corresponding to a set of descriptors.
 * LoopClosing uses only its score method, which compares two BoWs.
 * KeyFrameDatabase uses score and size, the latter simply reports the number of words in the vocabulary.
* Tracking is limited to passing it to the objects it builds. It acts as handrails.
