/* *
 * LocalMapping has a single instance running the Run method on its own thread.
 * It maintains the local map, adding keyframes when Tracking creates them,
 * And looking for new triangulating points from neighboring keyframes.
 *
 * Has two sets of methods: one for local map computation, one for thread interaction.
 * The latter handle finite automata of interaction, usually initiated from outside,
 * Such as via RequestReset, RequestStop or RequestFinish.
 *
 * Computer methods are protected and invoked from Run.
 *
 * There is no formal entity that represents the "local map".
 * The local map is a global map subset, rooted in the reference keyframe,
 * Involving the neighbors in the graph.
 *
 *
 * Public methods for interaction with the thread
 *
* The Run method has an infinite loop, which runs on its own thread. Communications with him are asynchronous:
 *
* - LocalMapping :: RequestStop prompts you to stop, pause. LocalMapping :: isStopped can be checked to confirm that it has stopped.
 * - Run enters a loop waiting for the signal to resume.
 * - LocalMapping :: Release prompts you to resume after a pause.
* - LocalMapping :: RequestReset reinitializes the object by cleaning variables. Invoked from Tracking :: Reset. The reset is asynchronous, there is no sign that it has already occurred.
* - LocalMapping :: RequestFinish requests to terminate. You can check with LocalMapping :: isFinished. In practice it does nothing.
