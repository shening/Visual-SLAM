 * Keyframe, keyframe.
 * ORB-SLAM identifies some frames as a key and adds them to the map.
 * A KeyFrame has more data than a Frame. When constructed copy the data of the Frame.
 * Frame is ephemeral, the KeyFrame remains on the map.
 * LocalMapping triangulates new map points exclusively from keyframes, not frames.
 * Tracking :: CreateNewKeyFrame has the exclusive creation of keyframes.
 *
 * Matrices
 *
 * - E: essential matrix, 3x3
 * - F: fundamental matrix, 3x3
 * - H: homography, 3x3
 * - K: intrinsic, chamber or calibration matrix, 3x3
 * - R: rotation matrix, 3x3, derived from a pose
 * - T: transformation, homogeneous matrix of 4x4, roto-structuring, to express poses
 *
 * Usual subindices:
 *
 * - Tcw: "Camera pose regarding World"
 * - F21: "fundamental matrix of table 2 with respect to 1"
 *
 * Vectors:
 *
 * - t: translation, derived from a pose
 *
 * Coordinates origin:
 *
 * The origin of coordinates by default is the world, whose origin is given by the pose of the first camera,
 * And the scale by the distance between the initialization chambers that triangulated the first points.
