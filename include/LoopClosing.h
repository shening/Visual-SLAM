 * Loop closure.
 * This singleton object executes the LoopClosing :: Run method on a unique thread.
 * Each time a keyframe is added to the map (LoopClosing :: CheckNewKeyFrames), it tries to detect a loop (LoopClosing :: DetectLoop).
 * If detected, compute your pose (LoopClosing :: ComputeSim3), correct the map (LoopClosing :: CorrectLoop) using the final step LoopClosing :: SearchAndFuse.
 *
 * Finishing the thread, to close the application:
 * 1- An external thread invokes LoopClosing :: RequestFinish, which marks mbFinishedRequested
 * 2 - In the main LoopClosing :: Run loop, LoopClosing :: CheckFinish reports that completion has been requested and exits the loop
 * 3- Before finishing the thread, LoopClosing :: Run invokes LoopClosing :: SetFinish (), which marks LoopClosing :: mbFinished.
 * 4- LoopClosing :: isFinished () reports that mark to other threads that ask.
 *
 * Reset:
 * Upon a bad initialization, Tracking :: Reset invokes LoopClosing :: RequestReset, which blocks the Tracking thread until LoopClosing reinitializes.
