/* *
 * Viewer represents the user interface.
 *
 * It consists of two parts, implemented in two classes: FrameDrawer and MapDrawer, both singleton.
 *
* FrameDrawer is responsible for generating the processed image with the map points and a status bar. Viewer shows it with imshow.
 *
 * MapDrawer is responsible for loading the 3D points of the world into Pangolin, the keyframes and camera poses.
 *
 * These two objects prepare what is shown, the action of taking it to the screen occurs in Viewer :: Run by:
 * - imshow
 * - pangolin :: FinishFrame
 *
 * Pause:
 * The viewer process can be paused from another thread:
 * - Viewer :: RequestStop to request the pause
 * - Viewer :: isStopped to check if it is paused
 * - Viewer :: Release to remove the pause and resume the process
 *
 * During the pause the display is not updated.
 *
 *
 * Termination:
 * The process is definitely finished to close the application with:
 * - Viewer :: RequestFinish to request termination
 * - Viewer :: isFinished to confirm that it is finished
