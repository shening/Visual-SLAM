 * ORBmatcher packages all descriptor mache methods.
 * The few properties are protected, they correspond to the configuration established in the construction.
 * Not to be confused with class ORBextractor, of similar name, that packs all the methods of extraction of descriptors.
 * All methods are invoked from other objects.
 * Only DescriptorDistance, which computes the distance between two descriptors with the Stanford algorithm,
 * Is also invoked internally by virtually all other ORBMatcher methods.
 *
 * While ORBextractor takes care of detecting unique points and extracting ORB descriptors,
 * ORBmatcher takes care of machear in several ways:
 *
 * - SearchByProjection part of a pose, projects the local map points that should be visible, and performs a circular mache.
 * - SearchByBoW machea first by BoW, and then by descriptors when there are several candidates with the same BoW.
 * - SearchForInitialization machea to find the first points of the map.
 * - SearchForTriangulation machea to find new 3D points.
 * - SearchBySim3 machea to evaluate candidates for loop closure.
 * - Fuse merges duplicate map points.
